# rqt_plot_qtcharts
An another plotting plugin for rqt based on the QtCharts module

## But why?

Yes I know about [rqt_plot](https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_plot) and [rqt_multiplot](https://github.com/ANYbotics/rqt_multiplot_plugin) plugins.
I miss the follwing features from them:
 * Show/hide individual plots by clicking on the legend
 * Add multiple Y axes and allow plots assigned to different axes (when tweaking PID controller it would be very useful)
 * Zoom with mouse wheel
 * Instantly editable axis scale: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ab1aIiMawGA
